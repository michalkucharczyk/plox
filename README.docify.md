# plox — Time Plots from Logs

## 🚀 What It Does

You give it logs. It gives you a graph.

Turn timestamped logs into clean plots.  Extract numeric values from log files and plot them over time. Fully CLI-driven. Regex-based. Configurable.

For some examples refer to [sample gallery](https://github.com/michalkucharczyk/plox/blob/master/SAMPLE.md).

## ✨ Features

- Regex-based field extraction with optional fast line filtering,
- Flexible timestamp parsing and unit-aware number handling,
- Compose multi-panel layouts to separate and group related metrics,
- Multiple input logs with per-file layouts and panel duplication support,
- Supports:
  - Numeric value plotting,
  - Fixed-value markers on event (pattern) match,
  - Cumulative event counting,
  - Time deltas between events,
- Reusable graph layouts via TOML config files
- Outputs PNGs (via gnuplot) and per-line CSV caches for fast redraws

## 📦 Install

```sh
cargo install plox
```
or
```sh
git clone git@github.com:michalkucharczyk/plox.git
cd plox
cargo build --release
# use ./target/release/plox 
```

`gnuplot` is required for rendering PNGs — install it via your system package manager.

## 📊 Case Study

This section walks through a real-world example of using `plox` to build a graph configuration progressively via the CLI — starting with a single metric, layering in more complexity, and finally extracting it into a reusable config.

### 🖥️ CLI Workflow

A sequence of `plox graph` commands that evolve from a simple one-liner to a complete multi-panel, multi-metric graph.

```sh
# basic plot: extract one value from logs
plox graph --input eve.log \
  --plot prune "validated_counter"

# add another value: prune duration
plox graph --input eve.log \
  --plot prune "validated_counter" \
  --plot prune "took:([\d.]+)(\w+)?"

# split into separate panels for clarity
plox graph --input eve.log \
  --plot prune "validated_counter" \
  --panel \
  --plot prune "took:([\d.]+)(\w+)?"

# switch to points with marker size
plox graph --input eve.log \
  --plot prune "validated_counter" --style points --marker-size 3 \
  --panel \
  --plot prune "took:([\d.]+)(\w+)?" --style points --marker-size 3

# write a graph config file (too complex for cli - file editing becomes more convenient)
plox graph --input eve.log \
  --plot prune "validated_counter" --style points --marker-size 3 \
  --panel \
  --plot prune "took:([\d.]+)(\w+)?" --style points --marker-size 3 \
  -w prune.toml

# try to extract first number from 'txs=(.., ..)' in 'maintain...' lines:
graph --input eve.log  \
   --plot maintain "txs=\((\d+),\s+\d+\)"

# edit/iterate the config, extract more data
plox graph --input eve.log -c prune.toml -o graph-old.png

# compare to another run
plox graph --input eve-new.log -c prune.toml -o graph-new.png

# apply same config to multiple files with per-file layout
plox graph --input charlie.log,ferdie.log,dave.log,eve.log \
  -c prune.toml --per-file-panels -o graph-all.png
```


### 📝 Graph Config

Once the command-line version becomes too complex to maintain comfortably, the configuration can be saved to a TOML file using `-w <graph-config-file>`. This creates a declarative layout that’s easy to version, inspect, and edit.

Below is a sample graph configuration representing where we eventually land in the case study. It’s functionally identical to the CLI commands above but significantly easier to maintain as the graph grows.

```toml
[[panels]]

[[panels.lines]]
guard = "prune:"
field = "validated_counter"
style = "points"
marker_size = 3.0
marker_type = "dot"
marker_color = "red"
title = "validation count in prune"

[[panels.lines]]
guard = "prune"
field = 'took:([\d\.]+)(\w+)?'
style = "points"
marker_size = 3.0
marker_type = "cross"
marker_color = "blue"
title = "prune duration [y2][ms]"
yaxis = "y2"


[[panels]]
panel_title = "txs"
legend = true

[[panels.lines]]
guard = "maintain"
field = 'txs=\((\d+),\s+\d+\)'
style = "steps"
line_color = "red"
title="watched txs"

[[panels.lines]]
guard = "maintain"
field = 'txs=\(\d+,\s+(\d+)\)'
style = "steps"
line_color = "blue"
line_width=2
title="unwatched txs"
```

## 📂 Working with Multiple Log Files

Multiple input logs can be passed via `--input`:

```sh
plox graph --input a.log,b.log ...
```

By default, each line (plot, event, etc.) is applied to **all input files** — unless it is bound to a specific file.

### 🔗 Binding a Line to a Specific File

To target a specific log file:

- Use `--file-id <N>` to refer to the *Nth* file in `--input`
- Or use `--file-name <path>` to bind directly to a filename

```sh
# apply this line only to c.log:
--input a.log,b.log,c.log --plot my-guard duration --file-id 2 

# apply this line to global-errors.log which is not used in --input:
--input a.log,b.log --plot my-guard "duration: ([0-9.]+)" --file-name globab-errors.log
```

### ✅ Without Binding, Lines Apply to All Inputs

If `--file-id` or `--file-name` is not set, the line is applied to **every file** in `--input`.

This is useful if comparing logs from the same system.

---

## 🔄 Panel Duplication

Use `--per-file-panels` to **separate outputs per input log**, which may improve readability of the graph.

This flag automatically duplicates each panel once per input file, **if that panel includes any unbound lines**. Then, it resolves each unbound line to exactly one input.

### How it works

- Unbound lines (no `file-id` or `file-name`) → assigned to exactly one file per duplicated panel
- Bound lines → copied into all panels unchanged
- Each final panel = one log file + one consistent layout

### Why it matters

This makes it easy to apply **a single graph layout across multiple logs**, with clean isolation:

```sh
plox graph --input a.log,b.log --per-file-panels \
  --plot worker "duration: ([0-9.]+)" \
  --file-name e.log --event-count "ERROR"
```

Results in:

| Panel  | Line                          | File        |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| 0      | `duration`                    | a.log       |
| 0      | `ERROR` (explicit file-name)  | e.log       |
| 1      | `duration`                    | b.log       |
| 1      | `ERROR` (explicit file-name)  | e.log       |

This lets applying the same layout to multiple inputs while keeping shared reference lines intact.

---

## 🕒 Time Ranges and Alignment

Each panel computes its own time range by merging the time spans of all its lines. This behavior is controlled by `--time-range-mode`, which determines whether the panel uses the full union or only the overlapping portion of its lines.

The X-axis range across panels can then be left independent or aligned globally. This is configured using `--panel-alignment-mode`.

If `--time-range` is provided, it overrides all automatic range calculation and applies a fixed global time window to all panels. Useful for "zooming" some interesting area.

## 🔧 Full CLI Reference

See `plox --help` for a complete list of options.

---

## 📄 Output Files

Running `plox graph` generates:

- `png` — rendered plot in given location (default: `graph.png`, or via `--output`)
- `gnuplot` — generated script (same location and name as PNG)
- CSV cache per log file (default: `.plox/` next to the log file), can be controlled by `--cache-dir`,

Regenration of CSV cache can be forced with `--force-csv-regen` flag.

Additionally the output PNG can be saved next to the input log file (if one log), or to in a common parent directory (if multiple input files are given) if `--inline-output <FILE>` is used.
